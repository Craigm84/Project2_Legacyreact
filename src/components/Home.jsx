      <h1>CODE WARS: THE RISE OF ANDY KING SKYWALKER</h1>
      <br />
      <h2>It is a time of turmoil in the galaxy. The sinister SAILESH PATEL, known as SIDIOUS PATEL'PATINE', has risen to power, threatening to enslave the galaxy under his iron rule. The noble VS KNIGHTS, guardians of peace and justice, are scattered and hunted.</h2>
      <br />
      <h2>Amidst the chaos, a young code-hand named ANDY KING SKYWALKER discovers he has a connection to the Force, a mystical energy that binds all living things. Guided by the wise and enigmatic CRAIG3PO, and inspired by tales of the legendary VS KNIGHT, LUKE SKYWALKER, Andy sets out on a journey to confront his destiny.</h2>
      <br />
      <h2>Joined by his loyal friend, MILESBACCA, a skilled pilot and mechanic, Andy embarks on a daring quest to find the lost VS TEMPLE, where he hopes to unlock the secrets of the Force and become a true VS KNIGHT.</h2>
      <br />
      <h2>But Sidious Patel'patine', sensing the growing power of Andy, unleashes his dark forces to stop him. Milesbacca, with his quick wit and daring piloting skills, becomes an invaluable asset to Andy's mission, guiding them through dangerous space routes and aiding in battles against Sidious' minions.</h2>
      <br />
      <h2>As they journey across the galaxy, Milesbacca's unwavering loyalty and bravery inspire Andy to persevere in the face of adversity. Together, they face countless trials and battles, forming a bond forged in the crucible of war.</h2>
      <br />
      <h2>In a climactic showdown, Andy and Milesbacca confront Sidious Patel'patine' atop the ancient ruins of the VS TEMPLE. With the strength of their friendship and the power of the Force, they stand united against the dark lord.</h2>
      <br />
      <h2>But tragedy strikes as Sidious, in a desperate bid to turn the tide of battle, strikes down Craig3PO, sacrificing the loyal droid to gain the upper hand. With a heavy heart, Andy and Milesbacca press on, fueled by the memory of their fallen comrade.</h2>
      <br />
      <h2>With Sidious Patel'patine' defeated and peace restored to the galaxy, Andy King Skywalker and Milesbacca continue their adventures as guardians of justice, traveling the stars and spreading hope to all who need it. And so, their legend lives on in the annals of galactic history...</h2>
